# Final project from Learning Code 2

My implementation of the final project of the *Learning Code 2* Book
in Apple Swift Playgrounds app for iPad.

I have two goals:

 * [ ] Procedural generation of landscape
    * [x] play with Heights Map
    * [ ] See how to use Perlin Noise algorithm in a "blocky" grid
* [x] Adapt the Right-Hand Rule Algorithm from *Learning Code 1* to jump()
